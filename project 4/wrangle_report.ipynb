    "3. Twitter json: A txt file which was manually downloaded from the Udacity sever as I was unable to obtain a twitter API. I read the file and extracted just the needed information from it which were the tweet_id, retweet_count and favorite_count.\n",

    "* The source column in the archieve dataset contains string of html values that should be categorical\n",
    "* Extended url column a similiar string url, only diffenciated by the tweet id which is already in the dataset\n",

    "1. I Merged the doggo, puppo, floofer and pupper columns into one column called dog_stage and dropped the columns as they are no longer needed.\n",

    "\n",
    "- quality issues\n",
    "4. Only original tweet were required so, to remove retweet data, I drop all row where the retweet_status_id were not null.\n",
    "5. Retweet columns are no longer of any importance as all values are null. I dropped them and other columns with very high null values. The columns  dropped were in_reply_to_status_id, in_reply_to_user_id, retweeted_status_id, retweeted_status_user_id, retweeted_status_timestamp\n",
    "6. The rating_denominator had multiple value. For even comparison of the rating_numerator the denominator has to be same. Since we had only 23 of them that were not 10, we dropped all rows with rating_denominator other than 10.\n",
    "7. Since all value in the rating_denominator are now same(ie 10), that column is no longer needed in the table so, I dropped the rating_denominator column.\n",
    "8. We now have just one rating column which is the rating_numerator so I simply changed the column name from rating_numerator to rating.\n",
    "9. The timestamp column was a string so I converted to datetime object.\n",
    "10. The souce column contained some long strings of html code with just four unique values. I mapped to some short and more readeable string obtained from the end of the html string. I then converted the souce column to pandas categorical datatype.\n",
    "11. The expandedurl column had similiar string for all row only differenciated by the tweet_id at the end. Since we already had the tweet_id on a separate column there is no need for the expanded_url column so, I dropped it.\n",
    "12. At this stage I checked for null values and still had 2 null values for retweet_count and favorite_count. I simply fillna for those columns using their mean values.\n",
    "13. The tweet_id column was an integer so I converted to string\n",
    "14. I dropped all observations with that are not dog. These observations had null values for columns from the image table\n",
